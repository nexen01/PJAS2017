Hello! 

Welcome to my [NAME] project! I made this November 2017 through February 2018.  
To use this program, open up command prompt or some equivilent. Go to the folder into which the file is. Make sure all supporting files are also there. Type "java -jar PJAS2017.jar". The program will then run without any further need for input. 
The program will export data to the file test.txt. There, data can be copied into a spreadsheet program to analyze.  


Thank you for taking the time to review my programs I made while in high school for no direct benefit.
